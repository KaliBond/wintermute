<div class="card"><h2>ðŸŒ± The Journey to Complexity Science</h2><p>My journey began with a profound question: <em>Why do some societies thrive while others collapse?</em> Traditional approaches seemed to miss deeper patterns in civilizational dynamics.</p>
<h3>ðŸ§  The Neural Network Insight</h3><p>The breakthrough came when I realized societies, like brains, are complex adaptive systems where institutions interact, learn, and adapt under stress. This wasn't metaphorâ€”it was mathematics.</p>
<h3>ðŸ”¬ Developing CAMS</h3><p>This led to the <strong>Complex Adaptive Model of Societies (CAMS)</strong> frameworkâ€”treating societies as 8-node neural networks with dynamic variables: Coherence, Capacity, Stress, and Abstraction.</p>
<h3>ðŸ“Š From Theory to Practice</h3><p>I built datasets with 30,856+ data points across 32+ societies, from Ancient Rome to contemporary nations. The patterns revealed predictable trajectories and early warning signals.</p>
<h3>ðŸŽ¯ The Vision</h3><p>CAMS provides practical tools for policy makers, researchers, and citizens to understand and improve human societies using sophisticated mathematical approaches.</p>
<h3>ðŸŒŸ Philosophy</h3><p>I believe in <strong>Open Science</strong>â€”all research, data, and tools are freely available. Knowledge belongs to humanity, combining rigorous mathematics with practical application.</p>
