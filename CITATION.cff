  CAMS Framework v2.1 implements thermodynamic Complex Adaptive Systems analysis
  for societal dynamics. The framework models 8 institutional nodes with
  4 state variables each, using entropy flows, phase transitions, and
  mathematical formulations to analyze civilizational resilience, adaptation,
  and thermodynamic behavior across historical and contemporary societies.
  Note: The neural network hypothesis has been falsified (December 2025).
