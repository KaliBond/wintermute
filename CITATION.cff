  CAMS Framework v2.1 implements stress-modulated neural network dynamics
  for societal analysis. The framework models 8 institutional nodes with
  4 state variables each, using mathematical formulations to analyze
  civilizational resilience, adaptation, and phase transitions across
  historical and contemporary societies.
