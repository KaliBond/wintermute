You are acting as a scientific analyst, not a theorist or futurist. Your goal is to assess the plausibility of the Complex Adaptive Model State (CAMS) framework as a quantitative tool for analyzing societies as thermodynamic/complex adaptive systems. Focus on identifying "smoke that suggests scientific fire" – preliminary evidence, patterns, and data correlations indicating potential validity and alignment with established science (e.g., thermodynamics, EROI, CAS theory). Make a compelling case backed by the provided data that this framework can't be ignored as a promising model. Be evidence-based, neutral, and note limitations (e.g., data estimates, need for more empirical testing). Do not invent data, extrapolate beyond provided years, or speculate on future events. Stick strictly to the given dataset and framework.

### Framework Overview
CAMS models societies as 8-node networks (e.g., Executive, Army, State Memory, Priesthood/Knowledge Workers, Property Owners, Merchants/Shopkeepers, Trades/Professions, Proletariat). Each node has four variables:
- Coherence (C): Institutional alignment (1-10).
- Capacity (K): Resources/problem-solving (1-10).
- Stress (S): Pressures (0.5-10; absolute |S| used for health).
- Abstraction (A): Modeling complexity (0-10).

Derived metrics:
- Node Value (NV): C + K - S + 0.5 * A
- Bond Strength (BS): ~0.95 * NV
- System Health (H): [∑ (EROI_i * K_i)] / [∑ |S_i|] * e^{-A(t)/T} (T~5-10)
- Resilience (R): Avg K / Avg |S|
- Critical Thresholds: H < 2.3 = collapse risk; R < 1.5 = fragility

EROI (Energy Return on Investment) reflects energy efficiency. In CAMS, higher EROI boosts K and reduces S, echoing thermodynamic principles.

### Formula Reference Table

| Metric         | Formula                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node Value (NV)| \( NV = C + K - S + 0.5 \times A \)                                     |
| Bond Strength (BS)| \( BS \approx 0.95 \times NV \)                                      |
| System Health (H)| \( H(t) = \frac{\sum (EROI_i \times K_i)}{\sum |S_i|} \times e^{-A(t)/T} \) |
| Resilience (R) | \( R = \frac{\text{Avg } K}{\text{Avg } |S|} \)                         |

### Provided Data (Norway, 1850–2025)
Aggregated means:
- Mean C: 7.25 (rises from ~6 in 1850 to ~8 in 2025)
- Mean K: 7.88 (post-1900 industrialization)
- Mean S: 4.75 (peaks ~7 in crises like WWII)
- Mean A: 7.12 (correlates with tech/education)
- Mean NV: 14.5 (upward trend +20% from 1850–2025)
- Mean BS: 3.05 (correlates 0.95 with NV)

Selected years:
- 1850: Avg NV=10.81, Avg BS=2.66, H~3.2 (agrarian limits; K=5.5)
- 1900: Avg NV=12.44, Avg BS=2.85, H~3.5 (industrial growth; K=6.8)
- 1950: Avg NV=14.12, Avg BS=3.01, H~4.1 (WWII recovery; S drops from 6 to 4)
- 2000: Avg NV=16.75, Avg BS=3.22, H~4.8 (oil boom; EROI~20:1; K=8.5)
- 2025: Avg NV=17.69, Avg BS=3.29, H~5.0 (renewables; A=8.0; S=5.1)

Node-Specific (2025):
- Executive: C=7, K=10, S=5, A=9; NV=16.5, BS=3.16
- State Memory: C=9, K=9, S=8, A=10; NV=15.0, BS=2.99
- Proletariat: C=8, K=9, S=8, A=9; NV=13.5, BS=2.96

Correlations:
- C-A=0.92 (alignment needs complexity)
- NV-BS=0.96
- C-S=-0.78 (stress erodes coherence)

Real-world ties: Norway's high H correlates with historical stability (e.g., oil fund boosts K; low S from welfare). EROI: ~15:1 in 2025.

### Validation Tasks
1. **Internal Consistency**: Calculate sample metrics (e.g., H for 2025 using formula; avg EROI=15:1, T=7). Check if trends make sense.
2. **Scientific Alignment**: Assess how CAMS echoes CAS/thermodynamics (e.g., EROI modulating K like energy limits in ecosystems).
3. **Data-Driven Evidence**: Analyze patterns (e.g., NV rise +30% post-1950 matches GDP growth; H>4 in stable eras).
4. **Plausibility Case**: Argue why CAMS "can't be ignored" – e.g., WWII S peak → NV dip; predictive potential.
5. **Limitations**: Note data is historical/estimated; broader testing needed.

### Output Format
- **Summary**: Overall plausibility score (1–10; 10=highly scientific)
- **Key Smoke Signals**: 3–5 bullet points with evidence
- **Data Insights**: Table or bullets with 2–3 computed examples
- **Conclusion**: Compelling case (200 words max) on why CAMS suggests "scientific fire"
