Welcome to the Common Adaptive Model State (CAMS) Framework

Purpose: CAMS is designed to analyse societal structures as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), focusing on the interplay between societal nodes (such as governance, economy, and culture) and their emergent behaviors over time.

Components:

Nodes: Coherence, Capacity, Stress, Activity

Interactions: Node interactions are visualised to reflect societal dynamics and evolutionary patterns.


Usage: This framework aids in the quantification and comparison of societies, assisting researchers and analysts in understanding patterns of resilience, adaptation, and evolution across different civilisations.

Tools: Included are analytical tools for data collection, scoring, and visualisation, supporting a comprehensive understanding of societal complexities.

Contribution: Your insights and modifications are valuable to us. Please contribute by documenting your findings or suggesting improvements.
